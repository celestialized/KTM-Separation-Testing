Summary of Sales Comparison Approach Suwannee County is a small rural county with, according to the 2000 US census, 34,844 residents in the entire
county. This fact translates to few sales. The sales used are the best available. No more recent comparable sales are available. Comp 1 is located in the same
subdivision as the subject and is the only sale in the subdivision in the past year. Comps 2 and 3 are located in a similar rural area and are similar in utility. A
time adjustment was necessary for comps 2 and 3 at negative 0.5% per month. The comps are in order of their weight given in determining the subject's
estimated market value.
