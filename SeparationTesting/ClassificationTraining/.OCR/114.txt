9. On all appraisals, subject to satisfactory completion, repairs, or alterations, the appraisal
report and value conclusion are contingent upon completion of the improvements in a
workmanlike manner.
10. Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous substances, including
without limitation asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyl, petroleum leakage, or agricultural
chemicals, which might or might not be present on the property, or other environmental
conditions, were not called to the attention of nor did the appraisers become aware of such
during the appraiser’s inspection. The appraisers have no knowledge of the existence of such
materials on or in the property unless otherwise stated. The appraisers, however, are not
qualified to detector test such substances or conditions. This appraisal has been prepared as
delineated in the Function of the Appraisal and does not constitute an expert inspection of the
property. If the presence of substances or environmental materials might affect the value of
the property, the value estimate is predicted on the assumption that there is no such material
or condition on or in the property or in such proximity thereto that it would cause a loss in
value. No responsibility is assumed for any such condition, or for any expertise or engineering
knowledge required to discover them. If desired, the client or lender should retain an expert
on this field. The only way to be certain as to condition of the property with respect to
“environmental hazards” is to have an expert in the field inspect the property. The appraisal
should not be relied on as to whether or not environmental hazards actually exist on the
property.
