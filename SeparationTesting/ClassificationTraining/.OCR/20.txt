STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITING CONDITIONS
— The appraiser will not be responsible for matters of a legal nature that affect f either the property being appraised or the title to it. The appraiser
assumes that the title is good and marketable and, therefore, will not render any opinions about the title. The property is appraised on the basis
of it being under responsible ownership.
— The appraiser may have provided a sketch in the appraisal report to show approximate dimensions of the improvements, and any such sketch
is included only to assist the reader of the report in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination of its size. Unless
otherwise indicated, a Land Survey was not performed.
— If so indicated, the appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( or other
data sources ) and has noted in the appraisal report whether the subject site is located in an identified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the
appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or implied, regarding this determination.
— The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question, unless specific
arrangements to do so have been made beforehand.
— If the cost approach is included in this appraisal, the appraiser has estimated the value of the land in the cost approach at its highest and best
use, and the improvements at their contributory value. These separate valuations of the land and improvements must not be used in conjunction
with any other appraisal and are invalid if they are so used. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, the cost approach value is not an insurance
value, and should not be used as such.
— The appraiser has noted in the appraisal report any adverse conditions ( including, but not limited to, needed repairs, depreciation, the presence
of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc. ) observed during the inspection of the subject property, or that he or she became aware of during the
normal research involved in performing the appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in the appraisal report, the appraiser has no knowledge of any
hidden or unapparent conditions of the property, or adverse environmental conditions ( including, but not limited to, the presence of hazardous
wastes, toxic substances, etc. ) that would make the property more or less valuable, and has assumed that there are no such conditions and
makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied, regarding the condition of the property. The appraiser will not be responsible for any
such conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist. Because the
appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, the appraisal report must not be considered as an environmental assessment of
the property.
— The appraiser obtained the information, estimates, and opinions that were expressed in the appraisal report from sources that he or she
considers to be reliable and believes them to be true and correct. The appraiser does not assume responsibility for the accuracy of such items
that were furnished by other parties.
— The appraiser will not disclose the contents of the appraisal report except as provided for in the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal
Practice, and any applicable federal, state or local laws.
— If this appraisal is indicated as subject to satisfactory completion, repairs, or alterations, the appraiser has based his or her appraisal report
and valuation conclusion on the assumption that completion of the improvements will be performed in a workmanlike manner.
— An appraiser's client is the party ( or parties ) who engage an appraiser in a specific assignment. Any other party acquiring this report from the
client does not become a party to the appraiser - client relationship. Any persons receiving this appraisal report because of disclosure requirements
applicable to the appraiser's client do not become intended users of this report unless specifically identified by the client at the time of the
assignment.
— The appraiser's written t consent and approval must be obtained before this appraisal report can be conveyed by anyone to the public, through
advertising, public relations, news, sales, or by means of any other media, or by its inclusion in a private or public database.
— An appraisal of real property is not a 'home inspection' and should not be construed as such. As part of the valuation process, the appraiser
performs a non - invasive visual inventory that is not intended to reveal defects or detrimental conditions that are not readily apparent. The presence
of such conditions or defects could adversely affect the appraiser's opinion of value. Clients with concerns about such potential negative factors
are encouraged to engage the appropriate type of expert to investigate.
The Scope of Work is the type and extent of research and analyses performed in an appraisal assignment that is required to produce credible
assignment results, given the nature of the appraisal problem, the specific requirements of the intended user ( s ) and the intended use of the
appraisal report. Reliance upon this report, regardless of how acquired, by any party or for any use, other than those specified in this report by
the Appraiser, is prohibited. The Opinion of Value that is the conclusion of this report is credible only within the context of the Scope of Work,
Effective Date, the Date of Report, the Intended User ( s ) , the Intended Use, the stated Assumptions and Limiting Conditions, any Hypothetical
Conditions and / or Extraordinary Assumptions, and the Type of Value, as defined herein. The appraiser, appraisal firm, and related parties assume
no obligation, liability, or accountability, and will not be responsible for any unauthorized use of this report or its conclusions.
Under USPAP Standards Rule 2 - 2 ( c ) , this is a Restricted Use Appraisal Report, and is intended only for the sole use of the named client. There are
no other intended users. The client must clearly understand that the appraiser's opinions and conclusions may not be understood properly
without additional information in the appraiser's work file.
In developing this appraisal, the appraiser has incorporated only the Sales Comparison Approach. The appraiser has excluded the Cost and
Income Approaches to Value, due to being inapplicable given the limited scope of the appraisal. The appraiser has determined that this appraisal
process is not so limited that the results of the assignment are no longer credible, and the client agrees that the limited scope of analysis is
appropriate given the intended use.
