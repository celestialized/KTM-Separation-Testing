18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this
Section 18, “Interest in the Property” means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property,
including, but not limited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for
deed, installment sales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by
Borrower at a future date to a purchaser.
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred ( or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred ) without
Lender’s prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured
by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise
is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The
notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance
with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If
Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any
remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.
19. Borrower’s Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain
conditions, Borrower shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument
discontinued at any time prior to the earliest of : ( a ) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to
any power of sale contained in this Security Instrument; ( b ) such other period as Applicable Law
might specify for the termination of Borrower’s right to reinstate; or ( c ) entry of a judgment
enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that Borrower : ( a ) pays Lender all sums
which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had
occurred; ( b ) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; ( c ) pays all expenses
incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’
fees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting
Lender’s interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and ( d ) takes such action
as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender’s interest in the Property and rights under
this Security Instrument, and Borrower’s obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security
Instrument, shall continue unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement
sums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender : ( a ) cash; ( b ) money
order; ( c ) certified check, bank check, treasurer’s check or cashier’s check, provided any such check
is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or
entity; or ( d ) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument
and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred.
However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 18.
20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial
interest in the Note ( together with this Security Instrument ) can be sold one or more times without
prior notice to Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity ( known as the “Loan
Servicer” ) that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and
performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and
Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale
of the Note. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the
change which will state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which
payments should be made and any other information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of
