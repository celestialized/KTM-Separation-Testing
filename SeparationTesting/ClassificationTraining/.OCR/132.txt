Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the
charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security
Instrument or by Applicable Law.
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally
interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with
the Loan exceed the permitted limits, then : ( a ) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and ( b ) any sums already collected from
Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to
make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to
Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment
without any prepayment charge ( whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the
Note ) . Borrower’s acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will
constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security
Instrument must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument
shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually
delivered to Borrower’s notice address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall
constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice
address shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by
notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower’s change of address. If
Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower’s change of address, then Borrower shall only
report a change of address through that specified procedure. There may be only one designated
notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall be given
by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender’s address stated herein unless Lender
has designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security
Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. If
any notice required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the
Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security
Instrument.
16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall
be governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All
rights and obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and
limitations of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to
agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against
agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the
Note conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security
Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision.
As used in this Security Instrument : ( a ) words of the masculine gender shall mean and
include corresponding neuter words or words of the feminine gender; ( b ) words in the singular shall
mean and include the plural and vice versa; and ( c ) the word “may” gives sole discretion without any
obligation to take any action.
17. Borrower’s Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security
Instrument.
