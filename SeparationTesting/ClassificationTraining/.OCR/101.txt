THE SALES COMPARISON APPROACH
In the sales comparison approach, value is estimated by comparing the property being appraised
with similar properties, which have sold. This method of estimating value is applicable when there
are a sufficient number of real sales of similar properties. The methodology is based on the premises
that market value is directly related to the availability of substitute properties with a similar utility
and desirability. If there are not enough sales of comparable properties, the sales comparison
approach may be less useful.
In applying the sales comparison approach, the appraisers researched the market for sales, contracts,
offers, and listings of competitive properties. These sales are examined and verified with
knowledgeable parties with regard to price; property rights conveyed financing terms and
conditions, transaction dates, physical condition, and buyer and seller motivation. The sale data is
then compared to the subject and a value estimate is concluded.
Units of comparison are the components into which the property is divided for comparison
purposes. These may include price per square foot, price per front foot, price per room, etceteras.
Elements of comparison are individual characteristics of sales which cause price to vary. These
elements include property rights conveyed, financing terms, condition of sale, market conditions,
location, physical characteristics, economic characteristics, use and non - realty items.
The adjustment process for the elements of comparison follows a specific order beginning with
property rights conveyed followed by financing items, and so on.
The analysis and adjustment process involves both quantitative and qualitative techniques.
Quantitative techniques include paired sales analysis, statistical analysis, trend analysis, and other
techniques.
Qualitative techniques include Relative Comparison Analysis, ranking analysis, and personal
interviews. Relative comparison analysis involves studying the relationship of sale data without
making quantitative adjustments. For example, a sale property may be considered superior, inferior,
or equal to the property being appraised. Ranking analysis puts the sale data in order of
comparability to the subject property. Personal interviews can be very insightful in making
qualitative adjustments.
The sales comparison approach derives income multipliers and income rates, which are used as
units of comparison. The appraiser does not adjust these units but rather explains the difference in
reconciling value conclusions.
The last step in the sales comparison approach is to reconcile the sale data into a value estimate. It
may also be necessary to reconcile different conclusions reached using varying techniques within
the sales comparison approach.
