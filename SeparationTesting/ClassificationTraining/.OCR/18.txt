Summary of Sales Comparison Approach The three closed sales listed above are the three most recently closed comparable sales from within the subject's
immediate market area. The condition for the subject and all comparables were confirmed by descriptions and / or interior and exterior photos provided by MLS. All
sales have closed within the past six months and are deemed the most reliable indicators of value at the time of this appraisal. A recent comparable sale without
a pool could not be located thus an adjustment for all sales was made for this feature based the depreciated cost to build a pool similar to the comparable sales.
Sale 3 was confirmed through MLS photos do be far inferior in condition to the subject. This sale was mostly original from when it was built.
