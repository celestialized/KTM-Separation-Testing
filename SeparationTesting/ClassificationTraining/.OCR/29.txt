GUIDANCE FOR COMPLETING THE ONE - UNIT RESIDENTIAL APPRAISAL FIELD REVIEW REPORT
The appraisal review function is important to maintaining the integrity of both the appraisal and loan underwriting processes. The following guidance is
intended to aid the review appraiser with the development and reporting of an appraisal field review :
1. The review appraiser must be the individual who personally read the entire appraisal report, performed a visual inspection of the exterior areas of the
subject property from at least the street, inspected the neighborhood, inspected each of the comparable sales from at least the street, performed the
data research and analysis, and prepared and signed this report.
2. The review appraiser must focus his or her comments on the appraisal report under review and not include personal opinions about the appraiser ( s )
who prepared the appraisal.
3. The lender / client has withheld the identity of the appraiser ( s ) who prepared the appraisal report under review, unless otherwise indicated in this report.
4. The review appraiser must assume that the condition of the property reported in the appraisal report is accurate, unless there is evidence to the
contrary.
5. This One - Unit Residential Appraisal Field Review Report is divided into two sections. Section I must be completed for all assignments. Section II must
be completed only if the answer to Question 10 in Section I is “No.”
6. The review appraiser must determine whether the opinion of market value is accurate and adequately supported by market evidence. When the review
appraiser disagrees with the opinion of value, he or she must complete Section II. Because appraiser’s opinions can vary, the review appraiser must
have conclusive evidence that the opinion of value is not accurate.
7. The review appraiser must explain why the comparable sales in the appraisal report under review should not have been used. Simply stating : “see grid”
is unacceptable. The review appraiser must explain and support his or her conclusions.
8. The review appraiser must form an opinion about the overall accuracy and quality of the data in the appraisal report under review. The objective is to
determine whether material errors exist and what effect they have on the opinions and conclusions in the appraisal report under review. When the
review appraiser agrees that the data is essentially correct ( although minor errors may exist ) , he or she must summarize the overall findings. When the
review appraiser determines that material errors exist in the data, he or she must identify them, comment on their overall effect f on the opinions and
conclusions in the appraisal report under review, and include the correct information.
9. The Questions in Section I are intended to identify both the positive and negative elements of the appraisal under review and to report deficiencies. The
review appraiser must make it clear to the reader what effect f the deficiencies have on the opinions and conclusions in the appraisal report. Simple “Yes”
and “No” answers are unacceptable.
10. The review appraiser must provide specific, supportable reasons for disagreeing with the opinion of value in the appraisal report under review in
response to Question 1 in Section II.
11. The review appraiser must identify any extraordinary assumptions that were necessary in order to arrive at his or her opinion of market value.
Extraordinary assumptions include the use of information from the appraisal report under review that the review appraiser concludes is reliable ( such as
an assumption that the reported condition of the subject property is accurate ) .
12. The review appraiser must include the rationale for using new comparable sales. The following question must be answered : Why are these new
comparable sales better t than the sales in the appraisal report under review?
13. The new comparable sales provided by the review appraiser and reported in the sales comparison analysis grid must have closed on or before the
effective f date of the appraisal report under review. It may be appropriate to include data that was not available to the original appraiser as of the
effective date of the original appraisal; however, that information should be reported as “supplemental” to the data that would have been available to the
original appraiser.
14. The review appraiser must provide a sale or transfer history of the new comparable sales for a minimum of one year prior to the date of sale of the
comparable sale. The review appraiser must analyze the sale or transfer data and report the effect, if any, on the review appraiser’s conclusions.
15. A review of an appraisal on a unit in a condominium, cooperative, or PUD project requires the review appraiser to analyze the project information in the
appraisal report under review and comment on its completeness and accuracy.
16. An appraisal review of a manufactured home requires the review appraiser to assume that the HUD data plate information is correct, unless information
to the contrary is available. In such cases, the review appraiser must identify the source of the data.
17. The review appraiser’s opinion of market value must be “as of” the effective f date of the appraisal report under review.
