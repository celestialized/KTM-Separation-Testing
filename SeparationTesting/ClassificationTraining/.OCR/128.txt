on the Property. Whether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the
Property in order to prevent the Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its
condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or restoration is not
economically feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further
deterioration or damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid in connection with damage
to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the
Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for
the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is
completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the
Property, Borrower is not relieved of Borrower’s obligation for the completion of such repair or
restoration.
Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it
has reasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender
shall give Borrower notice at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such
reasonable cause.

application process, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with
Borrower’s knowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or
statements to Lender ( or failed to provide Lender with material information ) in connection with the
Loan. Material representations include, but are not limited to, representations concerning
Borrower’s occupancy of the Property as Borrower’s principal residence.

in the Property and / or rights under this Security Instrument ( such as a proceeding in bankruptcy,
probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this
Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations ) , or ( c ) Borrower has abandoned the Property,
then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender’s interest in
the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and / or assessing the
value of the Property, and securing and / or repairing the Property. Lender’s actions can include, but
are not limited to : ( a ) paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority over this Security

off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not
under any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any
or all actions authorized under this Section 9.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of
Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate
