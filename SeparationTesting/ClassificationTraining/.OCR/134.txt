transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other
than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower will remain with
the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed by the Note
purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action ( as
either an individual litigant or the member of a class ) that arises from the other party’s actions
pursuant to this Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision
of, or any duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has
notified the other party ( with such notice given in compliance with the requirements of Section 15 )
of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of
such notice to take corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse
before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of
this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to
Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed
to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 20.
21. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21 : ( a ) “Hazardous Substances” are
those substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental
Law and the following substances : gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products,
toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and
radioactive materials; ( b ) “Environmental Law” means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction
where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental protection; ( c )
“Environmental Cleanup” includes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as
defined in Environmental Law; and ( d ) an “Environmental Condition” means a condition that can
cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.
Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any
Hazardous Substances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property.
Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property ( a ) that is in
violation of any Environmental Law, ( b ) which creates an Environmental Condition, or ( c ) which,
due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance, creates a condition that adversely
affects the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use,
or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized
to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property ( including, but not
limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products ) .
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of ( a ) any investigation, claim, demand,
lawsuit or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the
Property and any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual
knowledge, ( b ) any Environmental Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking,
discharge, release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance, and ( c ) any condition caused by
the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the
Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, or any
private party, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the
Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance
with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an
Environmental Cleanup.
