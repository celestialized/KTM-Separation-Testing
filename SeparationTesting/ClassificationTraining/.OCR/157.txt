which from the character or use of said property may be reasonably necessary, the specific enumerations herein not excluding the general.
( 2 ) To provide, maintain and deliver to Beneficiary fire insurance satisfactory to and with loss payable to Beneficiary. The amount collected under any fire or
other insurance policy may be applied by Beneficiary upon any indebtedness secured hereby and in such order as Beneficiary may determine or at option of

notice of default hereunder or invalidate any act done pursuant to such notice.
( 3 ) To appear in and defend any action or proceeding purporting to affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of Beneficiary or Trustee; and to pay all
costs and expenses, including cost of evidence of title and attorney’s fees in a reasonable sum, in any action or proceeding in which Beneficiary or Trustee may

when due, all encumbrances, charges and liens, with interest, on said property or any part thereof, which appear to be prior or superior hereto; all costs, fees
and expenses of this Trust.
Should Trustor fail to make any payment or to do any act as herein provided, then Beneficiary or Trustee, but without obligation so to do and without notice to
or demand upon Trustor and without releasing Trustor from any obligation hereof, may, make or do the same in such manner and to such extent as either may
deem necessary to protect the security hereof, Beneficiary or Trustee being authorized to enter upon said property for such purposes; appear in and defend
any action or proceeding purporting to affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of Beneficiary or Trustee; pay, purchase, contest or compromise any
encumbrance, charge, or lien which in the judgement of either appears to be prior or superior hereto; and, in exercising any such powers, pay necessary
expenses, employ counsel and pay his or her reasonable fees.
( 5 ) To pay immediately and without demand all sums so expended by Beneficiary or Trustee, with interest from date of expenditure at the amount allowed
by law in effect at the date hereof, and to pay for any statement provided for by law in effect at the date hereof regarding the obligation secured hereby, any
amount demanded by the Beneficiary not to exceed the maximum allowed by law at the time when said statement is demanded.
B. It is mutually agreed :
( 1 ) That any award of damages in connection with any condemnation for public use or injury to said property or any part thereof is hereby assigned and
shall be paid to Beneficiary who may apply or release such moneys received by him or her in the same manner and with the same effect as above provided for
regarding disposition of proceeds of fire or other insurance.
( 2 ) That by accepting payment of any sum secured hereby after its due date, Beneficiary does not waive his or her right either to require prompt payment
when due of all other sums so secured or to declare default for failure so to pay.
( 3 ) That at any time or from time to time, without liability therefor and without notice, upon written request of Beneficiary and presentation of this Deed and
said note for endorsement, and without affecting the personal liability of any person for payment of the indebtedness secured hereby, Trustee may; reconvey
any part of said property; consent to the making of any map or plat thereof; join in granting any easement thereon; or join in any extension agreement or any
agreement subordinating the lien or charge hereof.

The Grantee in such reconveyance may be described as “the person or persons legally entitled thereto.”
( 5 ) That as additional security, Trustor hereby gives to and confers upon Beneficiary the right, power and authority, during the continuance of these Trusts,
to collect the rents, issues and profits of said property, reserving unto Trustor the right, prior to any default by Trustor in payment of any indebtedness secured
hereby or in performance of any agreement hereunder, to collect and retain such rents, issues and profits as they become due and payable. Upon any such
default, Beneficiary may at any time without notice, either in person, by agent or by a receiver to be appointed by a court, and without regard to the adequacy of
any security for the indebtedness hereby secured, enter upon and take possession of said property of any part thereof, in his or her own name sue for or
otherwise collect such rents, issues, and profits, including those past due and unpaid, and apply the same, less costs and expenses of operation and collection,
including reasonable attorney’s fees, upon any indebtedness secured hereby, and in such order as Beneficiary may determine. The entering upon and taking
possession of said property, the collection of such rents, issues and profits and the application thereof as aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any default or notice
of default hereunder or invalidate any act done pursuant to such notice.
( 6 ) That upon default by Trustor in payment of any indebtedness secured hereby or in performance of any agreement hereunder, Beneficiary may declare
all sums secured hereby immediately due and payable by delivery to Trustee of written declaration of default and demand for sale and of written notice of

thereafter may postpone such sale by public announcement at the time fixed by the preceding postponement. Trustee shall deliver to such purchaser its deed
conveying the property so sold, but without any covenant or warranty, express or implied. The recitals in such deed of any matters or facts shall be conclusive
proof of the truthfulness thereof. Any person, including Trustor, Trustee, or Beneficiary as hereinafter defined, may purchase at such sale.
After deducting all costs, fees and expenses of Trustee and of this Trust, including cost of evidence of title in connection with sale, Trustee shall apply the
proceeds of sale to payment of : all sums expended under the terms hereof, not then repaid, with accrued interest at the amount allowed by law in effect at the

or successors to any trustee named herein or acting hereunder, which instrument, executed by the Beneficiary and duly acknowledged and recorded in the
office of the recorder of the county or counties where said property is situated, shall be conclusive proof of property substitution of such successor Trustee or
