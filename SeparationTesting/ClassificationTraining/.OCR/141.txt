( b ) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; ( c ) premiums for any and
all insurance required by Lender under Section 5; and ( d ) Mortgage Insurance premiums,
if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of the payment of Mortgage
Insurance premiums in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. These items are
called “Escrow Items.” At origination or at any time during the term of the Loan, Lender
may require that Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be
escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item.
Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this
Section. Borrower shall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives
Borrower’s obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive
Borrower’s obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time.
Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay
directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which
payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to
Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require.
Borrower’s obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all
purposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security
Instrument, as the phrase “covenant and agreement” is used in Section 9. If Borrower is
obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay
the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and
pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender
any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any
time by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and, upon such revocation,
Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under
this Section 3.
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount ( a ) sufficient to
permit Lender to apply the Funds at the time specified under RESPA, and ( b ) not to
exceed the maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA. Lender shall estimate
the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable estimates of
expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable Law.
The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal
agency, instrumentality, or entity ( including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose
deposits are so insured ) or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall apply the
Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA. Lender
shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the
escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on
the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless an
agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds,
Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds.
Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the
Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds
as required by RESPA.
