All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to
Lender’s right to disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name
Lender as mortgagee and / or as an additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the
policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all
receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage,
not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy shall
include a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and / or as an additional loss
payee.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender.
Lender may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower
otherwise agree in writing, any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was
required by Lender, shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or
repair is economically feasible and Lender’s security is not lessened. During such repair and
restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had
an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender’s
satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse
proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the
work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to
be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or
earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower
shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the
restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender’s security would be lessened, the
insurance proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not
then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the
order provided for in Section 2.
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available
insurance claim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from
Lender that the insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle
the claim. The 30 - day period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender
acquires the Property under Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender
( a ) Borrower’s rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid
under the Note or this Security Instrument, and ( b ) any other of Borrower’s rights ( other than the
right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by Borrower ) under all insurance policies covering
the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property. Lender may use
the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or to pay amounts unpaid under the
Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.
