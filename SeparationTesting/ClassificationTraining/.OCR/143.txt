services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which
reasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be
responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination resulting from an
objection by Borrower.
If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may
obtain insurance coverage, at Lender’s option and Borrower’s expense. Lender is under
no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such
coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect Borrower, Borrower’s equity
in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and
might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower
acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might significantly
exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed
by Lender under this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this
Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of
disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to
Borrower requesting payment.
All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be
subject to Lender’s right to disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage
clause, and shall name Lender as mortgagee and / or as an additional loss payee and
Borrower further agrees to generally assign rights to insurance proceeds to the holder of
the Note up to the amount of the outstanding loan balance. Lender shall have the right to
hold the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires, Borrower shall promptly
give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains
any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or
destruction of, the Property, such policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and
shall name Lender as mortgagee and / or as an additional loss payee and Borrower further
agrees to generally assign rights to insurance proceeds to the holder of the Note up to the
amount of the outstanding loan balance.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier
and Lender. Lender may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless
Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in writing, any insurance proceeds, whether or not
the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall be applied to restoration or repair
of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender’s security
is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to
hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such
Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender’s satisfaction, provided that
such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the
repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work
is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires
interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay
Borrower any interest or earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other
third parties, retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and
