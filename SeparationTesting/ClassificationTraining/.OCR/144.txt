shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the restoration or repair is not economically
feasible or Lender’s security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied
to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess,
if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided
for in Section 2.
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any
available insurance claim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30
days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then
Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30 - day period will begin when the notice
is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 22 or
otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender ( a ) Borrower’s rights to any insurance
proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security
Instrument, and ( b ) any other of Borrower’s rights ( other than the right to any refund of
unearned premiums paid by Borrower ) under all insurance policies covering the Property,
insofar as such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property. Lender may use the
insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or to pay amounts unpaid under
the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.
6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as
Borrower’s principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security
Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower’s principal residence
for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in
writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating
circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower’s control.
7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections.
Borrower shall not destroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to
deteriorate or commit waste on the Property. Whether or not Borrower is residing in the
Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent the Property from
deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant
to Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall
promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further deterioration or damage. If
insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid in connection with damage to, or the taking
of, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property
only if Lender has released proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds
for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as
the work is completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to
repair or restore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of Borrower’s obligation for the
completion of such repair or restoration.
Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the
Property. If it has reasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements
on the Property. Lender shall give Borrower notice at the time of or prior to such an
interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.
