INCOME APPROACH
The Income Approach is a technique for estimating the market value of the subject property, which
requires the capitalization of net income to value. Value, from a broad appraisal viewpoint, is most
practically defined as the present worth of future benefits. This definition is derived from the basic
economic principle of anticipation, which asserts that value lies in futures. In addition, value may be
described as the relationship between the thing described and a potential purchaser. This latter
definition is clearly related to the former; that is, the quality of the relationship must be strongly
influence by the purchaser’s estimate of future benefits.
When estimating value by the Income Approach, the appraiser must :
1. Forecasts the property’s gross earnings potential
2. Estimate net income by deducting an appropriate vacancy allowance and operating
expenses. This figure represents the net monetary benefits of ownership.
The final step, appropriately discounting anticipated future earnings to judge their present worth, is
termed capitalization. The most important consideration in the capitalization process is selecting the
proper capitalization method for property under appraisal. The method of deriving a capitalization
rate should be that method most often used in the market place for similar properties.
There are several methods or techniques for estimating the value of the subject property by the
Income Approach. The methods are the following :
− Direct Capitalization : in the direct capitalization an overall rate derived from the market
sales is applied to a net income estimate to derive an indication of Market Value.
− Straight Capitalization : in the straight capitalization the capital structure of property value
consist of land plus improvements. Thus, the overall rate is a weighted average of the risk
rate, which is applicable to land, and the building capitalization rate, which is applicable to
the improvements.
− Mortgage Equity Analysis : in the mortgage equity analysis, the Band of Investment
technique is the weighted average of the mortgage constant ( applied to the loan to value
percent –i.e., 70% to 75% ) and the equity dividend rate ( applied to the amount of equity –
i.e., 25% to 30% ) . This is the most often used commercial income valuation method.
The subject property is not leased at present and the rental is calculated and based on similar rented
properties in the area or for rent at the time of the appraisal report.
