Preface to Cost Breakdown
The appraiser will use the comparative square foot method in estimating the reproduction cost of the
subject’s structures. This method estimates the total cost by comparison with similar buildings; the
cost of which are known and have been reduced to units per square foot of the building’s content.
Under this method, the actual costs of similar buildings are divided by the number of square feet of
floor or ground area resulting in a cost per square foot.
The square foot figure is reflective of both direct and indirect cost of construction. The direct cost
cover construction and labor cost. Indirect costs cover variables such as the following : engineering
and architectural fees, legal fees, financing and mortgage fees, taxes during construction, leasing costs
during construction, interest reserves and administrative expenses.
Accrued depreciation was considered in our analysis. In appraisal terminology, it is the difference
between the reproduction cost and the property’s market value, as of the date of appraisal.
Depreciation is a loss in property value from deterioration and / or obsolescence. Deterioration in a
structure is evidenced by wear and tear, decay, dry rot, cracks, encrustation, or structural defects.
Obsolescence is divided into two parts, functional and external.
Functional obsolescence occurs due to poor floor plan, inadequacy or super adequacy due to size,
style, age , mechanicals, etceteras. It is evidenced by conditions within the property.
External obsolescence is caused by factors outside the property such as changes in the property uses
or demand, legislation, etceteras.
Deterioration and obsolescence can be further classified as curable or incurable. Curable refers to
those items of physical deterioration, which are immediately repaired or replaced by a prudent
property owner. Incurable refers to those elements of physical deterioration and functional
obsolescence, which cannot be corrected; or if possible to correct, the resultant incremental increase
in value would not warrant the expenditure necessary to cure the defect. It is noted that external
obsolescence is almost always incurable.
The appraiser utilized the Marshall and Swift valuation grid to estimate the reproduction cost new of
the subject property. SEE THE FOLLOWING PAGE. The improvements square footage unit costs
were weighted based on physical inspection.
