Summary of Sales Comparison Approach The three closed sales listed above are the three most recently closed comparable sales from within the subject's
immediate market area. All three sales closed within the past 90 days and are deemed the most reliable indicators of value at the time of this report. All sales are
similar to the subject in terms of bedroom count and livable area. The condition for the subject was confirmed by MLS photos which were taken just before the
effective f date of this appraisal. The appraiser is making an extraordinary assumption that the subject is in the same condition as the MLS photos show. Please
see attached photos. The condition of the comparable sales were also confirmed by interior photos provided by their MLS listings and the written descriptions.
Greatest emphasis was given to Sale 1 when arriving at the subject's estimated value since this sale is located in the subject's building and is similar to the
subject in every aspect except being inferior in condition.
