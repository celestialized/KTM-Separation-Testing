regulatory in nature, and whether arising by general statute or particular program statute, or by regulation, rule, or order issued pursuant thereto,
disclosure may be made to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, foreign, State, local, or tribal, or other public authority responsible for enforcing,
investigating or prosecuting such violation or charged with enforcing or implementing the statute, or rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant thereto,

component thereof; or ( b ) any employee of the agency in his or her official capacity where the Department of Justice has agreed to represent the
employee; or ( c ) the United States Government, is a party to litigation or has an interest in such litigation, and by careful review, the agency deter -
