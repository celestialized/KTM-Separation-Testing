If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of
the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not
merge unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.
10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making
the Loan, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect.
If, for any reason, the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from
the mortgage insurer that previously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make
separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay
the premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance
previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage
Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected by Lender. If
substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall continue to
pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance
coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non -
refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non - refundable,
notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to
pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss
reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage ( in the amount and for the period that Lender
requires ) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and
Lender requires separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If
Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required
to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower
shall pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non -
refundable loss reserve, until Lender’s requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with
any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until
termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 10 affects Borrower’s obligation
to pay interest at the rate provided in the Note.
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender ( or any entity that purchases the Note ) for certain
losses it may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the
Mortgage Insurance.
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time,
and may enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses.
These agreements are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the
other party ( or parties ) to these agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to
make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available ( which may
include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums ) .
As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any
reinsurer, any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive ( directly or
indirectly ) amounts that derive from ( or might be characterized as ) a portion of Borrower’s
payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer’s risk,
or reducing losses. If such agreement provides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the
insurer’s risk in exchange for a share of the premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often
termed “captive reinsurance.” Further :
