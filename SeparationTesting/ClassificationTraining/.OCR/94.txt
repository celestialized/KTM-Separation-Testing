THE COST APPROACH
The cost approach is primarily based on the principal of substitution. The principle of substitution
states that a person is not justified in paying more for a property than the total cost of acquiring the
land, and construction of a building of equal utility, without undue delay.
The appraisers may use either reproduction cost or replacement cost. Reproduction cost is the cost
to create an exacted duplicate of the property being appraised using the same materials, design and
workmanship. This would include any existing deficiencies, super adequacies, and / or functional
obsolescence. Replacement cost is the estimated cost to construct a building with equivalent utility
using modern materials and current standards of design and floor plan.
Cost is divided into direct or hard cost, and indirect or soft cost. Direct cost is the expenditures for
labor and materials used in constructing the improvements. This cost includes contractor’s overhead
and profit, but not entrepreneurial profit. Direct cost includes building permits, materials,
equipment, labor, utilities during construction, and performance bonds.
Indirect cost is those cost that are not typically included in the construction contract. Those may
include architectural and engineering fees, appraisal, legal, accounting, and consulting fees;
financing cost during construction, risk insurance and ad valorem taxes during construction,
marketing costs, tenant improvement expenses, and administrative expenses as the developer.
Entrepreneurial profit recognizes the motivation and contribution of the developer. Entrepreneurial
profit is market derived and is the difference between the cost to build the improvements and the
market value. Entrepreneurial profit may or may not exist. There is no guarantee that the
expenditures to build an improvement will guarantee a profit to the developer.
Cost figures may be obtained from a professional cost estimator or from construction contracts. Cost
figures may also come from files on actual costs of buildings maintained by the appraiser. Other
sources of cost figures are cost estimating services such as Marshall and Swift and Boeckh
Publications.
The three traditional cost estimating methods are the comparative unit method, the unit - in - place
method and the quantity survey method. The difference in these methods is the level of detail of
materials, equipment, and labor used in the improvements. The comparative unit and units - in - place
methods are most often used by appraisers.
When the subject property represents a proper improvement, meeting the definition of highest and
best use, this approach when properly applied will correlate well with the other two approaches, ( the
sales comparison approach and the income approach ) when applicable.
