Permissible Use.
Analysis of the permissible uses at the subject site take into account those uses which would be
permitted relative to existing zoning and / or deed restrictions which are imposed on the site.
Although a formal title search has not been made and submitted to the Appraiser, it is my
assumption that no deed restrictions are in effect at the subject site, which would be considered
restrictive to the usage of said site.
After analysis of the physically possible and legally permissible uses to which the subject site could
conceivably be put, a study of that use which would be considered economically and financially
feasible is required. My analysis of the alternative usages at the subject site indicates Religious
facility would be considered to represent the Highest and Best Use of the site.
HIGHEST AND BEST USE AS IMPROVED
In that the existing improvements are already constructed at the site, the overall subject property
becomes an integral part of both land and building. This integration of land and improvements
relates to the economic concept of the marginal dollar. This theory applies that the existing land and
improvements will remain in their existing usages as long as the property, as improved, has a
Market Value which is higher than that of the land as if vacant and available for a higher usage. In
this study of Highest and Best Use is the principle of contribution, which states that the value of a
component part of an overall property is dependent upon how much it contributes to the value as a
whole.
Therefore, based on my analysis, it is my estimate that the Highest and Best Use of the subject
property, as improved, would be for a Religious facility.
Real Property Rights Conveyed
The sale property may require adjustment to the sale price if the property rights conveyed are
reflective of a leased fee estate when contract rents are not at the market level. Also, a leasehold
estate may require adjustment if, for example, a property is sold separately from its site. In such
cases, the value of the fee simple estate would have to be estimated by adding the leased fee estate
to the leasehold estate.
Financing Terms and Condition of Sale
The sale property’s price can differ drastically from that of a property considered highly physically
competitive because financing arrangements or terms of sale can vary. The financing of each
competitive property should be considered and the necessary adjustments should be made to reflect
variations in rates, term, and other factors for proper comparison with the subject. The financing is
compared as of the date of sale and adjusted for then market rate.
