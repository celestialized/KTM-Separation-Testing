SECTION II — COMPLETE ONLY IF REVIEW APPRAISER ANSWERS "NO" TO QUESTION 10 IN SECTION I.
1. Provide detailed reasoning for disagreement with the opinion of value in the appraisal report under review. OA's Sales 2 & 3 are non mls sales. Sales 4 - 6 are developer sales
and are therefore not the best indicators of value due to the developer being involved as of the effective f date of the appraisal. OA's Comparable 5's sales price was
incorrect at $335,900 and sold for $300,000.
2. State all extraordinary assumptions used ( i.e. gross living area, room count, condition, etc. ) . All information regarding the subject property and market area that could not
be reverified are assumed to be correct as of the effective f date of the original appraisal 11 / 1 / 2007.
3. Provide a new opinion of value as of the effective date of the appraisal report under review using the below sales comparison analysis grid.
( NOTE : This may or may not include the use of the same comparable sales in the appraisal report under review. )

Analysis of prior sale or transfer history for the comparable sales. All prior sales / transfers if any for the 12 months prior to the sale date of the comparable are listed above.
Summary of Value Conclusion ( including detailed support for the opinion of value and reasons why the new comparable sales are better t than the sales used
in the appraisal report under review ) . All new sales were outside the subject project and sold thru the mls. These three sales are deemed the most reliable indicators
of the subject's estimated value at the time of the effective f date. Sales 1 & 3 are located in newer buildings like the subject with Sale 2 being located in an older building.
Sale 1 seems to have sold above market value at the time for an unknown reason. Sales 2 & 3's sales prices are more in line with other recent comparables sales
through MLS. The condition for closed Sales 1 - 3 were confirmed through the descriptions and / or interior photos provided by MLS.
REVIEW APPRAISER’S OPINION OF MARKET VALUE ( Required only if review appraiser answered “No” to Question 10 in Section 1 )
Based on a visual inspection of the exterior areas of the subject property from at least the street or complete visual inspection of the
interior and exterior areas of the subject property, defined scope of work, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and appraiser’s
certification, my opinion of the market value, as defined, of the real property that is the subject of this report is $ 325,000 ,as of
, which is the effective date of the appraisal report under review.
