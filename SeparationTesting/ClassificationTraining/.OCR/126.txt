4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and
impositions attributable to the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument,
leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees,
and Assessments, if any. To the extent that these items are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them
in the manner provided in Section 3.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument
unless Borrower : ( a ) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a
manner acceptable to Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement;
( b ) contests the lien in good faith by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings
which in Lender’s opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are
pending, but only until such proceedings are concluded; or ( c ) secures from the holder of the lien an
agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender
determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which can attain priority over this
Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days of the
date on which that notice is given, Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions
set forth above in this Section 4.
Lender may require Borrower to pay a one - time charge for a real estate tax verification
and / or reporting service used by Lender in connection with this Loan.
5. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter
erected on the Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term “extended
coverage,” and any other hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which
Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts ( including deductible
levels ) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding
sentences can change during the term of the Loan. The insurance carrier providing the insurance
shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender’s right to disapprove Borrower’s choice, which right
shall not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection with this
Loan, either : ( a ) a one - time charge for flood zone determination, certification and tracking services;
or ( b ) a one - time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and subsequent
charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might affect such
determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees
imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood
zone determination resulting from an objection by Borrower.
If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain
insurance coverage, at Lender’s option and Borrower’s expense. Lender is under no obligation to
purchase any particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender,
but might or might not protect Borrower, Borrower’s equity in the Property, or the contents of the
Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was
previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained
might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts
disbursed by Lender under this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this
Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of
disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower
requesting payment.
