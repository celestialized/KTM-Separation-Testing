If an attachment is used, the borrower ( s ) must sign the attachment. The following
language must be inserted, using capital letters :
"THIS LOAN MUST EITHER BE PAID IN FULL AT MATURITY OR REFINANCED TO
A MARKET LEVEL FIXED - RATE MORTGAGE. YOU MUST REPAY THE ENTIRE
PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN AND UNPAID INTEREST THEN DUE IF YOU
DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE CONDITIONAL RIGHT TO REFINANCE AS
SPECIFIED IN THE NOTE ADDENDUM AND MORTGAGE RIDER. THE LENDER IS
UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REFINANCE THE LOAN IF QUALIFICATION
CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET. YOU WILL, THEREFORE, BE REQUIRED TO MAKE
PAYMENT OUT OF OTHER ASSETS THAT YOU MAY OWN, OR YOU WILL HAVE
TO FIND A LENDER, WHICH MAY BE THE LENDER YOU HAVE THIS LOAN WITH,
WILLING TO LEND YOU THE MONEY. IF YOU REFINANCE THIS LOAN AT
MATURITY, YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY SOME OR ALL OF THE CLOSING COSTS
NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW LOAN EVEN IF YOU OBTAIN
REFINANCING.”
For California Applications
California Civil Code 1812.30 ( j ) requires that credit applications clearly specify that
the applicant, if married, may apply for a separate account. This requirement is not
inconsistent with the language at the beginning of Form 1003.
Lenders may revise the description of the "Married" box in Section III for Borrowers
and Co - Borrowers by adding " ( includes registered domestic partners ) ." If lenders are
unable to insert the language due to the format of the form, this language may be
added to the continuation sheet or included as an attachment to Form 1003.
