extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this
Security Instrument or the Note without the co - signer’s consent.
Subject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower
who assumes Borrower’s obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is
approved by Lender, shall obtain all of Borrower’s rights and benefits under this Security
Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from Borrower’s obligations and liability
under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing. The
covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind ( except as provided in
Section 20 ) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in
connection with Borrower’s default, for the purpose of protecting Lender’s interest in the
Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to,
attorneys’ fees, property inspection and valuation fees. In regard to any other fees, the
absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to
Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may
not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable
Law.
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is
finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in
connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits, then : ( a ) any such loan charge shall
be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and ( b )
any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be
refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal
owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces
principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment
charge ( whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note ) . Borrower’s
acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a
waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this
Security Instrument must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this
Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first
class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower’s notice address if sent by other means.
Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable
Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address
unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender.
Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower’s change of address. If Lender
specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower’s change of address, then Borrower shall
only report a change of address through that specified procedure. There may be only one
designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to
Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender’s
address stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to
Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument shall not be deemed to
