MARKET VALUE DEFINED
The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all
conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and
assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation
of a sale as of a specific date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under condition whereby :
1 ) Buyer and seller are typically motivated;
2 ) Both parties are well informed or well advised, and each, acting in what they
consider their own best interest;
3 ) A reasonable time allowed for exposure in the open market;
4 ) Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or terms of financial arrangements
comparable thereto.
5 ) The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by
special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with
sale.
In essence, this appraisal report’s market value estimate is based on cash or its equivalent as of a
specified date, or specific financing based on rate and terms delineated hereunder, if applicable.
