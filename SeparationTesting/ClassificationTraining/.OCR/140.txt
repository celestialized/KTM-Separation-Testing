check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency,
instrumentality, or entity; or ( d ) Electronic Funds Transfer.
Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location
designated in the Note or at such other location as may be designated by Lender in
accordance with the notice provisions in Section 15. Lender may return any payment or
partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to bring the Loan
current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the
Loan current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse
such payment or partial payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such
payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as
of its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender
may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring the Loan current.
If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply
such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied
to the outstanding principal balance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No
offset or claim which Borrower might have now or in the future against Lender shall
relieve Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument
or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.
2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this
Section 2, all payments accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following
order of priority : ( a ) interest due under the Note; ( b ) principal due under the Note; ( c )
amounts due under Section 3. Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic Payment
in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shall be applied first to late
charges, second to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument, and then to
reduce the principal balance of the Note.
If Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment
which includes a sufficient amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be
applied to the delinquent payment and the late charge. If more than one Periodic
Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from Borrower to the
repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid
in full. To the extent that any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full
payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late
charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges and
then as described in the Note.
Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to
principal due under the Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the
amount, of the Periodic Payments.
3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic
Payments are due under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum ( the “Funds” ) to
provide for payment of amounts due for : ( a ) taxes and assessments and other items which
can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the Property;
