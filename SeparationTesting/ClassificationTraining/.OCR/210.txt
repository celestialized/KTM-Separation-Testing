X. Information for Government Monitoring Purposes
This section is included to aid the federal government in monitoring compliance with
equal credit opportunity, fair housing and home mortgage disclosure laws. Supplying
this information is strictly voluntary on the part of the applicant, but lenders should ask
all applicants to provide it, including those who apply by telephone and through the
Internet, and should describe the reason for collecting this data. Race and ethnicity
are separate categories, and although the lender should ask applicants to furnish
information for both, applicants may furnish one but not the other. Note that there is
no longer a place for applicants to indicate race as "Other" but applicants may check
as many races as apply.
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and its implementing Regulation C generally
require Lenders to collect sex, race, and ethnicity data on all applications.
When an application is taken in person and an applicant elects not to provide some
or all of this information, federal law requires the lender to note the applicant's sex,
ethnicity, and race on the form, based on the lender's visual observation or the
applicant's surname. To aid in identifying applicants who may be of Hispanic ethnicity
and who elect not to self - identify, the lender may wish to consult the list of Spanish
surnames developed by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Furthermore, the lender may
wish to advise the applicant that he may complete or change the information in this
section after the application is approved, at any time up until closing.
To Be Completed By Interviewer
The interviewer must complete this portion of the form to indicate the method used to
take the application and to provide the name and telephone number of the
interviewer, as well as his or her employer's name and address.
To Be Completed By Loan Originator ( for PDF dated 06 / 09 for mortgage loans
applications taken on or after January 1, 2010 )
The loan originator must complete this portion of the form to indicate the method used
to take the application and to provide the loan originator's name, ID, and telephone
number, as well as his or her employer's name, company ID, and address.
Continuation Sheet / Residential Loan Application
Lenders may amend this section by including space to evidence intent to apply for
joint credit. Other approaches, such as including this information on a separate
document, are also acceptable to Fannie Mae, provided they meet the requirements
of applicable law. Lenders should consult counsel to determine their alternatives.
Special Notice for Balloon Mortgages
For each balloon mortgage, the lender must insert a special notice regarding the
nature of the balloon features on Form 1003 or in a separate attachment to the form.
