effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected by Lender. If substantially equivalent
Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall continue to pay to Lender
the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance
coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a
non - refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be
non - refundable, notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and
Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss
reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance
coverage ( in the amount and for the period that Lender requires ) provided by an insurer
selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately
designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required
Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to
make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance,
Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to
provide a non - refundable loss reserve, until Lender’s requirement for Mortgage Insurance
ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing
for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this
Section 10 affects Borrower’s obligation to pay interest at the rate provided in the Note.
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender ( or any entity that purchases the Note ) for
certain losses it may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is
not a party to the Mortgage Insurance.
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time
to time, and may enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk,
or reduce losses. These agreements are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the
mortgage insurer and the other party ( or parties ) to these agreements. These agreements
may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds that the
mortgage insurer may have available ( which may include funds obtained from Mortgage
Insurance premiums ) .
As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another
insurer, any reinsurer, any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may
receive ( directly or indirectly ) amounts that derive from ( or might be characterized as ) a
portion of Borrower’s payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or
modifying the mortgage insurer’s risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement provides
that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer’s risk in exchange for a share of the
premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed “captive reinsurance.”
Further :
( a ) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has
agreed to pay for Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such
agreements will not increase the amount Borrower will owe for Mortgage
Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.
