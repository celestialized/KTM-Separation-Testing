Tip. You may be able to get your tax return or return information from other sources. If you had your tax return completed by a paid preparer, they
should be able to provide you a copy of the return. The IRS can provide a Tax Return Transcript for many returns free of charge. The transcript
provides most of the line entries from the original tax return and usually contains the information that a third party ( such as a mortgage company )
requires. See Form 4506 - T, Request for Transcript of Tax Return, or you can quickly request transcripts by using our automated self - help service
tools. Please visit us at IRS.gov and click on “Get a Tax Transcript...” or call 1 - 800 - 908 - 9946.

Caution : If the tax return is being mailed to a third party, ensure that you have filled in lines 6 and 7 before signing. Sign and date the form once you
have filled in these lines. Completing these steps helps to protect your privacy. Once the IRS discloses your tax return to the third party listed on line

information, you can specify this limitation in your written agreement with the third party.
