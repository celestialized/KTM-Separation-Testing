otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums
secured by this Security Instrument whether or not the sums are then due.
If the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to
Borrower that the Opposing Party ( as defined in the next sentence ) offers to make an
award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to respond to Lender within 30 days
after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and apply the
Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums
secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due. “Opposing Party” means
the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom
Borrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds.
Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal,
is begun that, in Lender’s judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other
material impairment of Lender’s interest in the Property or rights under this Security
Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate
as provided in Section 19, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a
ruling that, in Lender’s judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material
impairment of Lender’s interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument.
The proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment
of Lender’s interest in the Property are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.
All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the
Property shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.

Extension of the time for payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by

Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or any Successors in
Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any
Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise
modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any
demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any
forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation,
Lender’s acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or Successors in Interest of
Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or
preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
13. Joint and Several Liability; Co - signers; Successors and Assigns Bound.
Borrower covenants and agrees that Borrower’s obligations and liability shall be joint and
several. However, any Borrower who co - signs this Security Instrument but does not
execute the Note ( a “co - signer” ) : ( a ) is co - signing this Security Instrument only to
mortgage, grant and convey the co - signer’s interest in the Property under the terms of this
Security Instrument; ( b ) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this
Security Instrument; and ( c ) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to
