INSTRUCTIONS
Uniform Residential Loan Application
The lender uses this form to record relevant financial information about an applicant
who applies for a conventional one - to four - family mortgage. Roman numerals in
these instructions correspond to the sections on the form.
Lenders must use the PDF dated 6 / 09 for mortgage loans applications taken on or
after July 1, 2010.
Printing Instructions
We provide Form 1003 in an electronic format that prints as a letter size document.
However, lenders may print Form 1003 as a legal size document or with different
fonts or margins that may affect pagination; we have no specific standards for the
number or size of pages the form may have. Consequently, the number and size of
pages will not affect compliance with Fannie Mae requirements pertaining to use of
the Uniform Residential Loan Application, provided that the content of the form has
not been materially altered. When printing this form, you must use the "shrink to fit"
option in the Adobe Acrobat print dialogue box.
Instructions
The lender may accept applications taken during a face - to - face interview, over the
telephone, through the mail, or via the Internet. The lender should complete all
blanks and attach any separate exhibits, details, or statements that are relevant to
underwriting the mortgage. The borrower ( s ) must sign the original application at the
time it is completed. If the application is taken over the telephone or via the Internet,
the borrower ( s ) must sign the completed application as soon as possible thereafter.
However, an electronic signature or facsimile of the borrower's signature is
acceptable as indicated in the "Acknowledgment and Agreement" section of the
application. The lender should retain the original application with the supporting
information provided by the borrower ( s ) . Before or at the loan closing, the
borrower ( s ) must sign the final application that the lender prepares based on its
verification of the information that the borrower ( s ) provided in the original application.
The instructions at the top of Form 1003 are consistent with the permissible
inquiries that creditors are allowed to make under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
( ECOA ) . Although ECOA permits the lender in a community property state to obtain
information regarding the liabilities of a borrower's spouse even though he or she is
not applying for the mortgage and his or her income will not be considered for loan
qualification purposes, we do not require the lender to obtain the information. This
also means that in states where another person shares community property rights
with the applicant, the lender does not need to include information on that person's
liabilities if he or she is not an applicant.
