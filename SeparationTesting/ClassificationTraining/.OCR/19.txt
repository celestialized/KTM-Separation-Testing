Indicated Value by : Sales Comparison Approach $ 400,000
Indicated Value by : Cost Approach ( if developed ) $ Indicated Value by : Income Approach ( if developed ) $
Final Reconciliation The sales comparison approach was considered most applicable because it best reflects the motives of the typical purchaser. The income
approach was not considered applicable or requested by the client. The income approach is not considered a reliable indicator of value due to the lack of tenant
occupied sales in this predominately owner occupied market.
