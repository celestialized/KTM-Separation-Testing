SUMMARY OF SALES COMPARISON APPROACH
When the market was researched it arrived to a low amount of closed sales in the past 12 months, the
research was extended to other cities and surrounding counties, however some closed sales found were
considered not competitive to the subject due to the inferior condition and or design. There was selected
comp # 1 which is a closed sale Religious facility, comp # 2 and comp # 3 which are List for sale Religious
facility, and comp # 4 which is Retail space.
Being the subject a Religious facility it falls in the commercial property category, however at the time the
subject is not an income producing property since 100% owner occupied having not rented space.
It is considered that the site to accommodate the subject building with an adequate parking lot should be
2 Acre, however having the subject 4.9 Acre it is considered that 2.9 Acre is an Excess Land which add
value to the property, this value was added to the “Estimated Value” arriving to “Total Estimated Value”.
No adjustment for difference in land with the comparables, since the Excess land is added to the subject
in the feasibility to be sold by separate.
Comp # 2 & # 3 List for sales adjusted @ 15% from the asking price which is the expected reduction for the
property to be sold; Comp # 4 was adjusted for income producing @ $150,000.
After analyzing researched data the appraiser arrived to the conclusion that comparables selected are
providing good support for the subject value.
All sales were either all cash to the seller, or financing was typical / standard and required no
financing adjustment. Each sale was considered to be cash equivalent
Price Per Sq Ft
Comparable # 1 $74.84
Comparable # 2 $78.05
Comparable # 3 $71.58
Comparable # 4 $77.83
The appraiser analyzed the adjusted Price per square feet of comparables after adjustments, which
were adequately weighted when arriving to the estimate value.
