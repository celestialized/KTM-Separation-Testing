GENERAL INFORMATION
A Loan Service Agent / Servicing Agreement is required. You may provide your own form of a Loan Servicing Agreement. If so, this form is not
required. PENSCO and its related entities are not responsible for servicing any loan, promissory note, or “debt investment.” PENSCO will not
monitor whether or not a borrower has defaulted; therefore, it will not provide notice to Account Owners if a default occurs. PENSCO requires
that the Account Owner appoint a loan servicing agent ( Agent ) to administer the Note.
