The cost approach consists of five distinct steps :
1 ) Valuation of the land as if vacant and put to its Highest and Best Use.
2 ) Estimation of reproduction cost or replacement cost of the existing structure
and / or improvements.
3 ) Estimate of accrued depreciation ( curable and incurable ) .
a ) Physical deterioration
b ) Functional obsolescence
c ) External obsolescence ( generally incurable )
4 ) The addition of the land value and other improvements, as well as the
entrepreneurial profit if applicable to arrive at a value indication via cost
approach.
5 ) Deduction of accrued depreciation from the cost new to arrive at a present
depreciated cost of improvement.
