At a minimum, the insurable improvements on the Mortgaged Premises must be insured for loss or damage from fire, lightning and
other perils ( windstorm, hail, explosion, riot, civil commotion, damage by aircraft, damage by vehicles and damage by smoke ) covered
within the scope of standard extended coverage. If any of the preceding perils ( e.g., windstorm ) is excluded from the primary insurance
policy, coverage of the excluded peril must be picked up through a secondary insurance policy such as may be written by a state
insurance pool. The insurance limits must at least equal the higher of :
• The unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage up to the replacement cost of the insurable improvements, even when the
unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage exceeds such replacement cost.
• 80 percent of the full replacement cost of the insurable improvements
The insured must maintain adequate insurance coverage even when the improvements are vacant or unoccupied and must notify all
insurers of any such change in occupancy in order to preserve the rights as mortgagee under the applicable insurance policy. The
deductible for fire, water ( not caused by flooding ) or wind damage to the insured improvements ( generally designated as "dwelling" in
the insurance policy ) may not exceed 5 percent of the limit maintained for dwelling coverage.
If the insurable improvements on the Mortgaged Premises is located in an area that has been identified as a Special Flood Hazard Area
on a flood map of FEMA, the insured must ensure that flood insurance is obtained and maintained on such improvements for the term
of the Mortgage. The terms and conditions of the flood insurance coverage must be at least equivalent to the terms and conditions of
coverage provided under the standard policy of the National Flood Insurance Program ( NFIP ) for the type of improvements insured.
