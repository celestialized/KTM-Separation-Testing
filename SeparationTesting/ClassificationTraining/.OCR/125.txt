be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower
shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower shall
pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower’s obligation to pay the
Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower’s obligation to pay to Lender Funds
for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of
such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow
Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish
to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require.
Borrower’s obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be
deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase
“covenant and agreement” is used in Section 9. If Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items
directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender
may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated
under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all
Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and, upon such
revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required
under this Section 3.
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount ( a ) sufficient to permit Lender
to apply the Funds at the time specified under RESPA, and ( b ) not to exceed the maximum amount a
lender can require under RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of
current data and reasonable estimates of expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in
accordance with Applicable Law.
The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency,
instrumentality, or entity ( including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured )
or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later
than the time specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying
the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender
pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge.
Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds,
Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and
Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to
Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESPA.
If there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account
to Borrower for the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in
escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and
Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the shortage in accordance with
RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments. If there is a deficiency of Funds held in escrow,
as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall
pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no
more than 12 monthly payments.
Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly
refund to Borrower any Funds held by Lender.
