Fannie Mae Guideline for choosing comparables :
• One - Unit Field Review : Comparable Sales Most Similar to Subject Property
For properties in new subdivisions or for units in new ( or recently converted ) condominium or PUD projects, the appraiser must
compare the subject property to other properties in its general market area as well as to properties within the subject subdivision
or project. This comparison should help demonstrate market acceptance of new developments and the properties within them.
Generally, the appraiser should select one comparable sale from the subject subdivision or project and one comparable sale
from outside the subject subdivision or project. The third comparable sale can be from inside or outside of the subject
subdivision or project, as long as the appraiser considers it to be a good indicator of value for the subject property. In selecting
the comparables, the appraiser should keep in mind that sales or resales from within the subject subdivision or project are
preferable to sales from outside the subdivision or project as long as the developer or builder of the subject property is not
involved in the transactions.
