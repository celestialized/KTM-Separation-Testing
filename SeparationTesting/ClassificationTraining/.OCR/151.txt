reinstate; or ( c ) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions
are that Borrower : ( a ) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security
Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; ( b ) cures any default of any
other covenants or agreements; ( c ) pays all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security
Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, property inspection
and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender’s interest
in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and ( d ) takes such action as
Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender’s interest in the Property and rights
under this Security Instrument, and Borrower’s obligation to pay the sums secured by this
Security Instrument, shall continue unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay
such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected
by Lender : ( a ) cash; ( b ) money order; ( c ) certified check, bank check, treasurer’s check or
cashier’s check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are
insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or ( d ) Electronic Funds Transfer.
Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations secured hereby
shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to
reinstate shall not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 18.
20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or
a partial interest in the Note ( together with this Security Instrument ) can be sold one or
more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity
( known as the “Loan Servicer” ) that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note and
this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under
the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more
changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If there is a change of the
Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the
name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be
made and any other information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer
of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer
other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower
will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are
not assumed by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial
action ( as either an individual litigant or the member of a class ) that arises from the other
party’s actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has
breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument, until
such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party ( with such notice given in
compliance with the requirements of Section 15 ) of such alleged breach and afforded the
other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective
action. If Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action
can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this
paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower
pursuant to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to
Section 18 shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action
provisions of this Section 20.
