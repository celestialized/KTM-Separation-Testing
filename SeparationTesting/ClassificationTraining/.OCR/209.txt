Note : The following instructions highlight certain sections of the form.
Introductory Statement
We recognize that the introductory paragraph of Form 1003 differs slightly from the
introductory paragraph in the Uniform Residential Loan Application found on Freddie
Mac's website, Freddie Mac Form 65. However, because we have determined that
these differences are not material, Fannie Mae will deem either version to comply
with our requirements for use of the Uniform Residential Loan Application.
V. Monthly Income and Combined Housing Expense Information
Gross Monthly Income : If the net cash flow for an investment property is a positive
number , it should be listed as "net rental income." If it is a negative number, it must
be included in the applicant's monthly obligations. If the property is a two - to four -
unit property for which the applicant occupies one of the units as a principal
residence, the monthly rental income should be listed as "net rental income."
Combined Monthly Housing Expense : The present monthly housing expenses for
the borrower and the co - borrower should be listed on a combined basis. The
proposed monthly housing expense for a two - to four - unit property in which the
applicant will occupy a unit as a principal residence should reflect the monthly
payment ( PITIA ) for the subject property. For all one - to four - unit investment
properties the present monthly housing expense should reflect the applicant's
principal residence.
VI. Assets and Liabilities
When the borrower's and co - borrower's assets and liabilities are not sufficiently
joined to make a combined statement meaningful, a separate Statement of Assets
and Liabilities ( Form 1003A ) should be completed for the co - borrower.
VII. Details of Transaction
The purchase price shown on Line "a" under the "Details of Transaction" should not
include any discounts or rebates or other allowances paid or allowed to the
purchaser. For refinancing, the amount being refinanced should be shown on Line
"d" - - Refinance. The figure should include the total amount of all existing liens plus
the costs of improvements that have been - - or will be - - made. Lines "a", "b", and "c"
should not be used to describe a refinance transaction.
VIII. Declarations
Noncitizen Applicants : If an applicant indicates in his response to Question J that he is
not a U.S. citizen, and also indicates in his response to Question K that he is not a
permanent resident alien, the lender may wish to ask whether he is a nonpermanent
resident alien or otherwise is lawfully present in the United States.
