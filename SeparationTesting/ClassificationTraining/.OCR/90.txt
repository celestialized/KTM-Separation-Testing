HIGHEST AND BEST USE
The reasonable and probable use that will support the highest present value, as defined, as of the
effective date of the appraisal.
Alternatively, that use, from among reasonable, probable and legal alternative uses, found to be
physically possible, legally permitted market supported and financially feasible, and maximally
productive.
In order to prove the highest and best use of improved property, the appraiser has to select the list of
possible uses for the property. Generally this is small and includes the current use plus several
closely related alternatives
The financial analysis of highest and best use of the improvements may become very complex.
Financial scenarios for each possible legal and appropriate supported is sometimes need. The
highest and best use of the property as improved is the use that results in the highest present
property value. The present value is that present worth of all forecast future net cash flows
discounted at a typical market rate of return.
Implied within these definitions is recognition of the contribution of that specific use to community
environment of to community development goals in addition to wealth maximization of the
individual property owner.
Also implied is that the determination of Highest and Best Use results from the appraiser's judgment
and analytical skills, i.e., that the use determined from analysis represents an opinion, not a fact to
be found. In appraisal practice, the concepts of Highest and Best Use represent the premise upon
which value is based. In the context of most probable selling price ( market value ) another
appropriate term to reflect Highest and Best Use would be most probable use. In the context of
Investment value, and alternative term would be most profitable use.
