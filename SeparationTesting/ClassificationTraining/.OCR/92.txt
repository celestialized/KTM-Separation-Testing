Market Conditions
The condition of the market can change between the time of sale and the date of the appraisal.
Therefore, adjustments might need to be reflected. Such changes often result from various factors
such as inflation, deflation, demand and supply. Typically, the trend in well - located real estate is for
property value to appreciate over time. This is especially pertinent in the area exhibiting natural
growth, not speculative growth, due to desirability of the area, new site improvements, and / or
population change.
Physical Characteristics
Physical characteristics can differ between a competitive property and the subject. Appraisers might
be required to judge the amount of value that is added or lost by physical difference. Variations in
site size, zoning, shape, and exposure for improved properties age, condition, architectural style, and
quality of construction are just a few of influencing factors. The appraiser must also recognize in the
adjustment process that some transactions are subject to a theory known as economies of scale.
This theory dictates that smaller vacant properties will usually sell at a higher unit price than larger
properties with similar physical characteristics. A similar highest and best use between the subject
and competitive property is also essential and diminishes the judgmental process and minimize
error.
Economic Characteristics
This comparison element usually applies to income producing properties and includes items such as
operating expenses, management quality, tenant quality, lease terms and conditions, expense pass -
troughs, etceteras.
Use
The adjustment process must include an analysis of and address, any difference in highest and best
use between the comparable sales and the subject. This includes verifying the ultimate use of the
sales property.
Non - Realty Components of Value
These items include personal property and business value or goodwill value. Personal property may
include furniture, fixtures, and equipment. Some property types inherently include a non - realty
component must be addressed. No non - realty components were addressed. This approach is most
relevant and relied upon heavily by market participants.
