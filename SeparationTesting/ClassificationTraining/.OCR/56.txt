APPRAISER'S CERTIFICATION : The Appraiser certifies and agrees that :
1. I have researched the subject market area and have selected a minimum of three recent sales of properties most similar and proximate to the subject property
for consideration in the sales comparison analysis and have made a dollar adjustment when appropriate to reflect the market reaction to those items of significant
variation. If a significant item in a comparable property is superior to, or more favorable than, the subject property, I have made a negative adjustment to reduce
the adjusted sales price of the comparable and, if a significant item in a comparable property is inferior to, or less favorable than the subject property, I have made
a positive adjustment to increase the adjusted sales price of the comparable.
2. I have taken into consideration the factors that have an impact on value in my development of the estimate of market value in the appraisal report. I have not
knowingly withheld any significant information from the appraisal report and I believe, to the best of my knowledge, that all statements and information in the
appraisal report are true and correct.
3. I stated in the appraisal report only my own personal, unbiased, and professional analysis, opinions, and conclusions, which are subject only to the contingent
and limiting conditions specified in this form.
4. I have no present or prospective interest in the property that is the subject to this report, and I have no present or prospective personal interest or bias with
respect to the participants in the transaction. I did not base, either partially or completely, my analysis and / or the estimate of market value in the appraisal report
on the race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin of either the prospective owners or occupants of the subject property or of the present
owners or occupants of the properties in the vicinity of the subject property.
5. I have no present or contemplated future interest in the subject property, and neither my current or future employment nor my compensation for performing this
appraisal is contingent on the appraised value of the property.
6. I was not required to report a predetermined value or direction in value that favors the cause of the client or any related party, the amount of the value estimate,
the attainment t of a specific result, or the occurrence of a subsequent event in order to receive my compensation and / or employment for performing the appraisal. I
did not base the appraisal report on a requested minimum valuation, a specific valuation, or the need to approve a specific mortgage loan.
7. I performed this appraisal in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice that were adopted and promulgated by the Appraisal
Standards Board of The Appraisal Foundation and that were in place as of the effective date of this appraisal, with the exception of the departure provision of those
Standards, which does not apply. I acknowledge that an estimate of a reasonable time for exposure in the open market is a condition in the definition of market value
and the estimate I developed is consistent with the marketing time noted in the neighborhood section of this report, unless I have otherwise stated in the
reconciliation section.
8. I have personally inspected the interior and exterior areas of the subject property and the exterior of all properties listed as comparables in the appraisal report.
I further certify that I have noted any apparent or known adverse conditions in the subject improvements, on the subject site, or on any site within the immediate
vicinity of the subject property of which I am aware and have made adjustments for these adverse conditions in my analysis of the property value to the extent that
I had market evidence to support them. I have also commented about the effect of the adverse conditions on the marketability of the subject property.
9. I personally prepared all conclusions and opinions about the real estate that were set forth in the appraisal report. If I relied on significant professional
assistance from any individual or individuals in the performance of the appraisal or the preparation of the appraisal report, I have named such individual ( s ) and
disclosed the specific tasks performed by them in the reconciliation section of this appraisal report. I certify that any individual so named is qualified to perform
the tasks. I have not authorized anyone to make a change to any item in the report; therefore, if an unauthorized change is made to the appraisal report, I will take
no responsibility for it.
